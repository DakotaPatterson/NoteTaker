  ## Description
  This project is a Note Taker that uses the user input to generate a list of notes using express.js. My motivation was to make an application that allowed users to create a list of notes to stay organized an dhave them all saved in one place. This application allows the user to input all the inofrmation about their notes and then save them to a list, they are also able to delete the exsisting notes. I have learned that express.js is useful to help users and developers to have a more streamlined development experience.
